This program was made on my own for CIS2520, with the use of the helper functions provided.

This assignment contains a variety of functions to play a game of tic-tac-toe, and "solve" the game.

The programs and associated object files can be compiled with 'make all'.
The program directory can be cleared with 'make clean'.

./alphatoe plays a game of tic-tac-toe.
./show_node takes any number of command line arguments. The arguments are the hash numbers
  of the boards to display, where 0 displays the starting board and boards may be numbered from
  0-19682 inclusive.
./count_nodes prints the number of valid boards.
